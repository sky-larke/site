Intro:
During the time period of 10/20 and 11/3, I worked with a partner, Blake, to create a wireframe using Adobe XD that met the specifications given for the Adobe x Amazon Design Jam.
Because we felt like it, we named our team Oat Milk (to acknowledge our mutual lactose intolerance &amp; the superiority of oat milk as a milk substitute.)

Adobe XD is an app in the same vein as Figma. I personally likened it to an elaborate PowerPoint-esque software. It even has the fancy transitions. This was my first time using the software, and my first time making a wireframe.">

For our home screen, we had a bar that reads the # of days the user has spent volunteering (to help motivate students to keep track of how much they’ve done).

I actually had the worst sleep schedule that I’d ever had in my life during this design jam, and the repercussions of that lasted quite a while, but it was very enjoyable to participate in a timed design project like this.\nBased upon my experience with this, I actually chose to participate in another one month later.
