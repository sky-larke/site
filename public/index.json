[{"content":"This started, as all problems do, with me making facetious claims without proof on the Internet.\nUser A Where did you feel that there were diminishing returns for tea? I\u0026rsquo;ve heard it\u0026rsquo;s at around 1$ per gram\nskylarke think somewhere around $1.20-$1.50 it has started feeling iffier for me\nAbout 10 seconds after posting that, I realized that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t actually back it up, and that really bothered me. Someone could ask me \u0026lsquo;Why?\u0026rsquo; and all I would be able to say was \u0026lsquo;It feels like it\u0026rsquo;, which is terrible for credibility. I like winning arguments and I hate being wrong, so I left the conversation to go find out the truth (specifically in a way that involved data and could be easily shown to others).\n120 teas participated. I\u0026rsquo;ve taken the info from my personal notes over the past year and a half which include tea category, subtype, region, price, and more. The majority of the teas I drink are oolongs, followed by puer. Prices range from $0.11-$2.50/g, although ~75% are below $0.5/g. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t take into account how frequently I drink each tea either, if I drink 100g of Dayi 7542 and twenty 8g oolong samples, the 7542 will only show up once.\nI have some data on Notion about prices and vendors, so I took that to a google sheets table. I used monkeysort to order them, which is a website that when given a list, shows you two options at a time. You choose the winner between them. There are no ties, no rock-paper-scissors scenarios, no elements of nuance, just straight up A or B. I went off of the question of \u0026ldquo;If I had A or B, which one would I drink?\u0026rdquo;. It was very vibes-based and I might have different answers tomorrow for the same teas. I reviewed the ranking after and moved some that I felt weren\u0026rsquo;t accurate, but there\u0026rsquo;s enough data that I feel that I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to split hairs and ranks could just be close enough. This does mean that the metric is continuous and evenly distributed, which isn\u0026rsquo;t the case in reality. There\u0026rsquo;s a large delineation between \u0026rsquo;top 5 teas ever!!\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;mid\u0026rsquo;. (Some people use tier lists, but due to a different online community I\u0026rsquo;m involved with, I\u0026rsquo;m mildly allergic to them due to the feeling that often there\u0026rsquo;s little-to-no internal consistency about the criteria for each tier. If there\u0026rsquo;s multiple criteria, why not just rank them based on the criteria? Why do the tiers need to be involved?)\nI measured cost efficiency using a metric that I will be referring to as \u0026ldquo;cost-rank score\u0026rdquo;, which I calculated by adding each item\u0026rsquo;s cost Z-score (# of standard deviations from the average) and its numerical rank\u0026rsquo;s Z-score. I used Z-score so the average would be 0 and teas would be evenly distributed for my overall score. Cost was measured in $USD/g, and I used the non-discounted cost of the tea. If I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the exact listing, I found the closest possible one, or I removed it from the data. Teas were ranked from 1-120, 1 being the best, 120 being the worst. After I added these values, I got each tea\u0026rsquo;s Z-score for cost + rank, which I used as my final value.\nI had some basic outlier checks. If the Z-score\u0026rsquo;s absolute value was greater than 3, I dropped it. Still caused some outliers.\nSome hypotheses I had:\n$1.2/g-$1.5/g is when diminishing returns begin (when it becomes less cost-efficient) ~$0.5/g is the most efficient price point for me Oolongs are the most price-efficient for me to buy Initial Results First, I began with a Google Sheets demo. These charts are generated from there. Here is the [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yZQ4RzxCBcF8WIU29-2kzYp-AzNq7K2YjRN2l3hfOj0/). Overall Oolong Puer White Green Black Initial Conclusions It was pointed out most of these lines are overfit and have lots of outliers, and I agree. This would be a very poor classifier, since it quite literally is only checking if price \u0026 rank (subjective enjoyment) are correlated. Also, the discrete ranking system I did here is rather flawed - in reality there can be ties, large gaps, etc. I simply did not see a good way of quantifying that, so I simplified it to the greatest extent. Perhaps I\u0026rsquo;m going in the wrong direction for this entirely. I want to figure out if a certain trait of a tea (price, type) correlates with my own subjective enjoyment.\nThis seems more of a classic regression problem, and it seems the data is set up perfectly for supervised learning. Also, it appears quite a few people have literal years worth of tea, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t it be helpful to predict the chance of liking a tea based upon previous experiences?\nWeb App Planning Since I have the repetitive task tolerance of a 6-year-old after five Monsters and a basket of Halloween candy, I was absolutely fed up with Google Sheets after getting this far. Formatting data manually was bad enough, making a classifier on there would be even more of a test of my patience. There will be more to this writeup - I just got caught up in actually making the app.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/teatracker/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis started, as all problems do, with me making facetious claims without proof on the Internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUser A\u003c/strong\u003e\nWhere did you feel that there were diminishing returns for tea?

Similar to the process of volunteering opportunities being spread through word of mouth, Forager features a recommendation and review system to allow users to see which opportunities their friends are involved with.\nWhen I was trying out different color palettes, I used a color-blindness simulation website to check for contrast. Here's an image that I filtered through it. I believe this is simulating red/green colorblindness. Here's a gif of the loading screen. Ignore my mouse, this is a preview on my computer, so my cursor is visible. This clip shows our settings sidebar, the general format for a post (including recommendations, location, reviews, etc), and the signup process. If we'd had more time we probably would have spent it to make the signup section a bit better, perhaps simulating an external link to a site/more specific timeslots. For our home screen, we had a bar that reads the # of days the user has spent volunteering (to help motivate students to keep track of how much they\u0026rsquo;ve done). We were also recommended by the Amazon UI/UX designer that we were able to meet with to add text to each important icon to increase our accessibility.\nThis one shows our filter overlay for search, with a demonstration of which filters \u0026 ways to sort were available. Reflection This was my first time participating in an Adobe design jam. I enjoyed the timed nature of it. 2 weeks was actually rather long, and I think I did not manage my time as well as I could have. I actually had the worst sleep schedule that I\u0026rsquo;d ever had in my life during this design jam, and the repercussions of that lasted quite a while, but it was very enjoyable to participate in a timed design project like this.\nBased upon my experience with this, I actually chose to participate in another one month later.

Its site is here.\nRole Timeline Tools Team Engineer \u0026amp; Designer 10 weeks from 4/1/21 - 6/9/21 RPGmaker MZ, Procreate June Hooper, Gabriel Villaroel Narvaez, Natalie Norquist I worked with four other freshman undergraduate engineering students to create a product for our client, Dr. Mitra Hartmann (also from NU). We had a pretty good time, especially when we were able to conduct research by playing Paper Mario and use $80 of our budget on RPGmaker MZ.\nThe site has most of the relevant information about the process and research, but I\u0026rsquo;ll include part of the executive summary here because I think it summed it up pretty well.\nLearning chemistry can be a daunting task. The first exposure that many students receive to the subject is in confusing, non-intuitive high school classes. This initial experience often causes students to form negative attitudes and turn away from chemistry permanently\u0026hellip;Ultimately, our challenge was to create a game that introduces elementary and middle school students to fundamental chemistry concepts and prompts interest in learning through engaging gameplay mechanics.\nWe approached our task from a user-centered perspective, aiming to create a game that appealed to students with little familiarity with chemistry and video game\u0026hellip; We also conducted multiple rounds of testing with three mockups to identify the game med ium (i.e. board games, card games, video games) that most effectively engaged our users.\nOur final design is a role-playing virtual game called ChemQuest, which was created using the game engine RPG Maker MZ. The design has four main components: (1) A narrative plot-line, (2) accessible aesthetic design, (3) a turn-based RPG battle system, (4) an interactive chemistry-themed world. The design primarily utilizes indirect chemistry, as students are exposed to the names of common molecules, periodic groups and their properties, and other chemistry-related vocabulary terms. The narrative plot-line and interactive world provide a clear sense of progression for the users, which keeps the students engaged with the game. This engagement also leads to a positive association with the subject of chemistry. As a role-playing game, ChemQuest encourages the player to identify with their chosen character, and the game\u0026rsquo;s accessible design allows for users of all backgrounds to feel represented. Aesthetically pleasing graphics keep the game fresh and exciting for students as they progress through the game. The game interface is also easily customizable, which supports children of differing abilities. Finally, the turn-based battle system subtly encourages users to practice their chemistry knowledge, as students must draw upon their understanding of periodic groups to defeat science-themed enemies in fantastical battles. Ultimately, ChemQuest is carefully imbued with chemistry content to produce an immersive, engaging learning experience.\nArt for the game. Here\u0026rsquo;s the art dump.\nI made this thing in 15 minutes in Procreate. Exported the gif incorrectly, so now I only have this low quality version because I lost the original files.\nCharacters were based upon an open-source RPGmaker character generator that I have currently forgotten the name of, and then edited for consistency. I went about making these characters by going around and asking my friends what RPG class \u0026amp; color they wanted after giving them some options.\n\u0026lt;img src =\u0026ldquo;multiportrait.png\u0026rdquo; alt = \u0026ldquo;Four hand-drawn portraits of fantasy characters. \u0026ldquo;width = 384\u0026gt;\nThese are some character dialogue portraits.
