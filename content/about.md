I'm currently a sophomore undergrad at Northwestern University majoring in Computer Science and aiming to get the Segal Design Certificate. I'm from Seattle, unless you're from Seattle, in which case I am actually from half an hour away. I like making things, enough that I'm involved with [Northwestern Formula Racing](https://northwesternformularacing.com/) (in the aerodynamics subteam, despite being a CS major) and do a good amount of random art, mostly digitally.
