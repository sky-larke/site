You play as Ari, who has been given a chance to redo one day that she regrets. It won't change the past. But you'll know whether there was something you could done differently, or not.
	
The typical visual novel or story-based game has paths & replayability, but you hav	to restart each time from scratch. This game is meant to have the player go through all 'paths' on each playthrough with a main character that knows that there are paths and choices to be made.
