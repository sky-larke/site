**Role:** UI/UX & Graphic Designer

**Timeline:** 2 weeks from 10/20/21 - 11/3/21

**Tools:** Adobe XD

**Teammate(s):** Blake Hu

During the time period of 10/20 and 11/3, I worked with a partner, Blake, to create a wireframe using Adobe XD that met the specifications given for the [Adobe x Amazon Design Jam](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/college-amazon-design-creative-jam-registration-166541960487)
Because we felt like it, we named our team Oat milk, and [this](https://xd.adobe.com/view/94a08104-eca9-45a6-83ba-4837b9a96b81-c1f3/) is the link to our final project.

Our project brief was:

> Inspired by Amazon's initiative, your challenge is to design an inclusive experience in a third-party mobile app for high school students looking for opportunities to fulfill community service hours or volunteer to help their local community, no matter what their background or ability.

Note: going to add some pictures here.
