During the time period of 10/20 and 11/3, I worked with a partner, Blake, to create a wireframe using Adobe XD that met the specifications given for the [Adobe x Amazon Design Jam](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/college-amazon-design-creative-jam-registration-166541960487)
Because we felt like it, we named our team Oat Milk.

> Forager is a volunteer-matching app designed using a social-media inspired framework to streamline the process for high schoolers looking for volunteer opportunities. Similar to the process of volunteering opportunities being spread through word of mouth, Forager features a recommendation and review system to allow users to see which opportunities their friends are involved with. 

Role      | Timeline | Tools  |  Team   |

| UI/UX & Graphic Designer | 2 weeks from 10/20/21 - 11/3/21| AdobeXD| Blake |

### Process
Amazon & Adobe started by releasing a brief that our wireframe design was based on.

> Inspired by Amazon's initiative, your challenge is to design an inclusive experience in a third-party mobile app for high school students looking for opportunities to fulfill community service hours or volunteer to help their local community, no matter what their background or ability.
